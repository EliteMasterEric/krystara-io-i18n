## Tips and Tricks

- Formatting is important; one missing comma or quotation mark can break the file, resulting in additional work.
- Values in double curly braces (such as `{{count}}`) represent a value that will be substituted later. Don't translate the word; instead, position the keyword (curly braces and all) where the appropriate number or words should be inserted.
- Values ending with `_plural` will automatically select between the singular and plural variant as appropriate. If the translation has no distinction between singular and plural values, omit the `_plural` key from the file.
